The liri app allows the user to query Musicians, Songs, and Movies to receive additional information. The info is pulled from BandsInTown, OMDB, and Spotify resources. To use the application, the user can either use the searches "spotify-this-song", "concert-this", or "movie-this". Only those three types of search will work with liri but if anything else is entered, the user will be prompted to "choose a different command". 

The first thing you can query is "spotify-this-song". In this example, I searched for the song Hello it returned that the musician was Adele and it gives an option to listen to the album that the song came from, "25". Screenshot below shows it in action:

Next is the query "movie-this" which allows the user to gain useful information on the movie of their choosing. In this case, I queried the movie harry potter. It returns one of the harry potter movies as well as useful information about the movie. In the future, would love to make it so that it displays all of the harry potter movies rather than just a random one. Screenshot below shows it in action:

Lastly is the "concert-this" command which allows the user to see where a musician of their choosing is performing in the near future. For this example, I chose the artist "zedd" and it returns to tell me that he is going to be performing in different countries overseas for the next few weeks.
