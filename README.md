# liri-app-thomas

They liri app allows the user to query Musicians, Songs, and Movies to receive additional information. The info is pulled from BandsInTown, OMDB, and Spotify resources. To use the application, the user can either use the searches "spotify-this-song", "concert-this", or "movie-this". Only those three types of search will work with liri but if anything else is entered, the user will be prompted to "choose a different command".
